I have an issue with m3u8 streams. I created Readable stream in which i push chunks retrieved from .aac files, and then I pipe the stream into a file. This works perfectly.
If I try to give this Readable stream to the Discord voice module, I can't get it to work. It worked literally the first time I implemented it, and never again.
I tried to use the m3u8stream library, and, this time, it worked... for one time, and never again. Now, what I'm trying to do is playing a live stream from a local radio, so I opened the ytdl-core module, since it can handle m3u8 live streams from youtube. I tried to hard-code my m3u8 url and leaving everything else unchanged, but it doesn't play. Not even once, this time. I tried to pipe it to a file, and I found out that the format is different (I can't open the youtube livestream file, but can open mine with .aac), which probably makes sense.
